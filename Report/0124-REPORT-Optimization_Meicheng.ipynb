    "Vegetation inversion methods could be generally classified as empirical methods or process-based approaches by applying radiative transfer model (RTM), which is a process-based physiological model that could simulate the reflectance of vegetation based on a number of vegetation paramters [(Jacquemoud, 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2008.01.026), including leaf area index ($LAI$), $Chl_l$, and leaf water content ($C_w$), etc. In either one of the two approaches, Optimization is applied to retrieve biophysical or biochemical vegetation parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between modelled and measured reflectance. Taking the leaf chlorophyll content ($Chl_l$) as an example. This parameter have been commonly studied since it is a crucial variable in regulating vegetation photosynthesis. Simple empirical models between reflectance and $Chl_l$ can be established by sampling multiple leaves and measuring their spectrum as well as $Chl_l$. However, this statistical method lack physiological foundations, and may be site- or/and time- dependent. More robust and transferrable model for $Chl_l$ estimation could be combining look up table ($LUT$) with RTM. Simpliy speaking, $LUT$ with a variety of $Chl_l$ is first developed with forward simluation of the $RTM$. Then, $Chl_l$ is obtained by finding the value that minimize the differences between measured and simulated reflective spectra in $LUT$ [(Jay, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.05.005). \n",

    "In my project, leaf nitrogen content ($[N]_L$) and leaf mass per area ($LMA$) are needed to be mapped with hyperspectral images in order to run the radiative transfer model that I want to compare. Since the ultimate goal is to evaluate RTM rather than developing a robust framework for nitrogen inversion, I will use empirical methods to estimate ($[N]_L$) and ($LMA$). With the ground-measured reflectance spectrum and lab-measured ($[N]_L$) and ($LMA$), statistical models such as partial least square regression (PLS) could be developed [(Ecarnot, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2012.10.013), where optimization is used for estimating the coefficient parameters.\n",
